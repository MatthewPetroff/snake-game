### Summary

Classic Snake Game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

__Object of the Game:__

Get the highest score possible by directing the snake towards the red apple.

__Controls:__

To start the game, choose the direction that the snake should move in and press the corresponding arrow key.

Moving the snake:
1. Press the _left arrow key_ to move left.
2. Press the _up arrow key_ to move up.
3. Press the _right arrow key_ to move right.
4. Press the _down arrow key_ to move down.

Once an arrow key is pressed, the snake will continue in that direction until another arrow key is pressed.

__Gameplay:__

For every red apple the snake eats, the score and the snake's length will increase by 1.

The game ends if:
1. The snake runs into the edge of the game board.
2. The snake runs into itself

Press the _NEW GAME_ button to start a new round.

This is the first non-commandline game that I have programmed. The Snake Game app introduced me to the _canvas_ element making it the first game I've programmed involving any type of graphics.
